The Local Events Map is a web-based application that allows users to explore and discover events happening around their city through an interactive map interface. 
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by the Leaflet.js library with OpenStreetMap, the project visualizes event locations using clickable markers. 
Each marker displays key event details such as the name, date, and a brief description in a popup window.
The application provides an intuitive and visually engaging way for users to view local activities like concerts, meetups, and exhibitions. It is designed to be simple yet effective,
offering smooth navigation and clear event visualization. 
Developers can easily modify or add new events by updating the JavaScript data array, making it a flexible and beginner-friendly project.
This project demonstrates practical use of map integration in web development, basic front-end design, and data handling using JavaScript. 
It can be expanded further by adding features such as event filters, user-submitted events, geolocation tracking, or database integration for real-time updates. 
Overall, it serves as an excellent introductory project for learning interactive web application development.
